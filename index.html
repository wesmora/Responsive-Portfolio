            <p>I've been a nerd at heart for as long as I can remember. 
            When I was a kid i used to break open my remote controlled 
            cars to see how they worked. When I turned 21 I became a broadcaster 
            because I wanted to learn how to use my voice.</p>

            </p>As a kid I would make diffrent voices and by high school 
            I had everyone wanting me to record their voicemail messages.</p>

            <p>Today I find myself on a new journey to become a wed developer.
            I'm not entirly sure where it will take me but getting educated 
            and upto speed is first. From there we'll take it a day at a time.</p>
